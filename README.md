**C++ Application Programming Interface for the `asm/termbits.h` C library**

---

The goal of this API is to provide developers with a modern C++ interface to the traditional C header asm/termbits.h.
It allows setting any baud rate supported by the hardware, not just the standard ones, enabling a more flexible communication process that is ideal for industrial or embedded applications requiring non-standard baud rates.
It uses **Object-Oriented Programming concepts**, **smart pointers**, **lambda functions**, and more to give your applications greater flexibility and power when dealing with **serial communication** in a **Linux environment**.

---

## Features

- üöÄ Modern C++ API for serial communication  
- üß† Object-Oriented design using smart pointers and RAII  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Full control of serial port configuration via `termios2`  
- üß© Example applications included  
- üêß Works only on Linux systems

---

## Build and Installation


```bash
# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/NestorDP/cppserial.git && cd cppserial

# Build the source code:
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Install the library (you will need to enter your sudo password):
sudo make install
```

<!-- ## Generate Documentation

You can build the API and user documentation with Doxygen and Sphinx.

Prerequisites:

- Doxygen (and optionally Graphviz for diagrams)
- Python 3 with pip
- Sphinx toolchain: see `docs/requirements.txt`

Install Python deps (recommended in a virtual environment):

```bash
# Optional: create/activate a venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Sphinx + theme + Breathe
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

### Build via CMake

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON
make docs     # builds Doxygen then Sphinx HTML
```

Output:

- Sphinx HTML: `build/docs/html/index.html`
- Doxygen HTML (optional): `build/doxygen/html/index.html`

Install location (optional):

```bash
sudo make install  # installs HTML docs under /usr/local/share/doc/libserial/html
``` -->

<!-- ### Option B: Build manually (without CMake)

```bash
# 1) Generate Doxygen (from the docs directory)
cd docs
doxygen Doxyfile

# 2) Build Sphinx HTML
cd ..
sphinx-build -b html docs build/docs/html  
``` -->

<!-- ## Run an Example Application

You can run an example application to test the libserial library in your environment.
Even without a physical serial device, you can test serial communication using a virtual serial port created with socat.

### Install socat (for virtual serial ports)

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install socat

# CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
sudo yum install socat    # or: sudo dnf install socat
```

### Create Virtual Serial Ports

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Create virtual serial ports
socat -d -d pty,link=/tmp/ttyV0,raw,echo=0 pty,link=/tmp/ttyV1,raw,echo=0
2022/09/09 11:13:10 socat[19050] N PTY is /dev/pts/2
2022/09/09 11:13:10 socat[19050] N PTY is /dev/pts/3
2022/09/09 11:13:10 socat[19050] N starting data transfer loop with FDs [5,5] and [7,7]
```

After this, your system will have two connected virtual serial ports.
In this example, /dev/pts/2 and /dev/pts/3 are linked to /tmp/ttyV0 and /tmp/ttyV1, respectively.

### Building Examples

You can build the examples using the main CMake system:

```bash
cmake .. -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
make examples
```

Or compile them individually:

```bash
g++ -std=c++14 -I../include examples/basic_communication.cpp -L../build -llibserial -o basic_comm
```

### Run Examples

To run a simple communication example, execute the basic_communication example:

```bash
# Terminal 2: Run the example
./basic_communication /tmp/ttyV0

# Terminal 3: Interact with the other end
echo "Hello from terminal!" > /tmp/ttyV1
cat /tmp/ttyV1
```

You can also run the list_ports example to display all available serial devices on your system:

```bash
./examples/list_ports
``` -->
